Distributing labelling budget
-----------------------------

We have one annotator, predicting next label costs nothing (compared to manual cost), so given a budget <img src="svgs/55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.86687624999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>, so we can have <img src="svgs/55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.86687624999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> iterations, in each we select only one product for manual labelling.

The problem then boils down, which product to select next?
- The one that resolves most conflicts: products with the highest number of label candidates?
- Or on the contrary: 
  
  > "In contrast, for an ambiguous instance which falls near the boundary of categories, even
those reliable workers will still disagree with each other and generate inconsistent labels.
For those ambiguous instances, we are facing a challenging decision problem on how much
budget that we should spend on them. On one hand, it is worth to collect more labels to
boost the accuracy of the aggregate label. On the other hand, since our goal is to maximize
the overall labeling accuracy, when the budget is limited, we should simply put those few
highly ambiguous instances aside to save budget for labeling less difficult instances."

Technically, the number of conflicting labels could be included in the weight function.

However, if in the first iteration we select only one item to label then all remaining items will get same label (which might be incorrect). In the begining we want to find items matching possibly all label classes. 

Also, conflicts are good because they lead to clarification. 

TODO:
- Experiment with current implementation to get some intuitions on budget allocation, number of iterations, when conflicts are good.
- If we don't have groundtruth labels, how do we know what is an optimal labelling, how to measure it? How they evaluated that in the paper?
